Completely customize the flow (and look) of the core WordPress wp-login.php, including background, logo, custom permalinks (instead of wp-login.php), activate new accounts by email,  default email from details, custom email templates, customize/responsify login/register/lost-password box, and more!

== Description ==

Looking to customize the core WordPress wp-login.php pages?  Maybe you want to use my `example.com/register` instead of `example.com/wp-login.php?action=register`?  What about emailing users an activation link when they register which lets them set their password? You can do all of this and more, with WP Login Flow.

We all know email is insecure, so why would you want to email your users their password in plain text?  This is what WordPress does by default. 

WP Login Flow uses the core WordPress wp-login.php forgot password methods to send users a link to activate their account, and then set their password.  You can completely customize the activation email, as well as completely rewrite *every* wp-login.php url (register, lost password, login, etc) using your own custom permalinks/rewrites.

You can also completely customize the default WordPress wp-login.php page, including background, logo, url, links, colors, border radius, and more!

WP Login Flow was intended to be completely bloat free, and integrate with the core of WordPress as much as possible.
